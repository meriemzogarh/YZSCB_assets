Competition in national and international markets has intensified significantly in recent years. Growing customer expectations in terms of quality and flexibility mean that our company and the entire supply chain face increasingly demanding challenges. Traditional logistics operations have transformed into an integrated, customer-focused management function, that increasingly constitutes a strategic success factor in our company's competitiveness. YAZAKI  Plants depend on cooperation with reliable, expert, and customer-focused suppliers. To achieve this challenging objective, the quality of our products and services must be part of the main considerations when designing new technical solutions. Delivering high quality product cannot be achieved without packaging providing proper protection. Packaging material is a critical part of the YAZAKI  product and service package offered to our customers. Our Suppliers are considered as key partners to succeed in achieving the challenging customer’s objectives. In this direction, the needs for packaging standard requirements have been growing at the same time as YAZAKI  Europe Limited’s growing success. This document is the result of a long study on how to further optimize product packaging with as purpose to bring values to our business partners: Customers and Suppliers. This packaging requirements manual is one of the key stones of future YAZAKI  and its business partner’s success. We rely on the support of every party in the application of these requirements.

Standard parts Non-Standard parts Tape / Foam Wire Spools /drums Clips / Fasteners Terminal reels Nuts / Bolts / Screws Convolute Tubing Connectors Extended Length Plastic Shields/Troughs Standard parts are hereby defined as parts which are small and / or uniform in configuration which will fit into a pre-determined set of hand-held / human movable boxes. Non-Standard parts are hereby defined as parts which require their own packaging system and / or SLC (Small Load Carrier) and pallet dimensions due to part configurations/sizes in order to ensure package and part integrity. The minimum requirements within these guidelines shall be met by all Component Suppliers shipping Standard & Non-Standard parts to YAZAKI . These requirements will help YAZAKI  and its Suppliers to achieve a high level of Quality performance in regard to automotive standards, environmental legal and local requirements and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) specific needs. Therefore, it is ultimately the Suppliers responsibility to ensure that their parts arrive at the end user undamaged. Suppliers must use packaging that withstands the various dynamics of all transportation methods as land, air and sea transport. Only one-part number is permitted to be shipped inside each box. Multiple part numbers inside one box is not permitted. 4.2.2 Packaging Design & Dimensions In order to enable a maximum fill rate of the pallet and the pallet footprint the container shall be modular. The preferred container dimension for the 1.200mm x 800mm footprint can be found in the following attachment: EA-SC (Significant/Special Characteristic)-xx-M-001-A-01.

Components features shall be considered: self-lubricated parts, moving parts, functional features, appearance, material, ESD Sensitive devices, etc. Cushioning packaging (airbag, bubble foil/wrap) or foam chips usage shall be avoided as much as possible. To be able to choose the proper inner packaging method, several parameters shall be taken into account: ▪ Does the part contain moving features? ▪ Is there any fragile area on the part? ▪ Is there a seal or self-lubricated component? ▪ What kind of material is the part made of? ▪ Is there any needed orientation of the part in the packaging for future processing? 4.2.7 Transport Packaging Design & Dimensions All shipments of the Component Suppliers shall be palletized. Deviations (e.g. for slip sheets) have to be mutually agreed. The following minimum design requirements have to be fulfilled: ▪ Footprint: 1.200mm x 800mm, 48” x 40” (1.219mm x 1.016mm) for US shipments ▪ Maximum pallet height (empty): 150mm ▪ Dynamic pallet Load Capacity conform 3m stack and it should be minimum 750kg ▪ 4-way free entry block pallet with three skids ▪ Forklift pocket minimum opening height: 88mm ▪ Solid wood pallet, no press wood pallet ▪ IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) treatment & marking according to ISPM 15 (latest version) Template: EA-QM-xx-P-001-F-01 Rev1.0 27/APR/2017 Print Date: 15/MAY/2023 Revision\"\n}\n\n\n--- element 10 ---\n{\n  \"filename\": \"Supplier Logistics Manual\",\n  \"section\": \"Part 10\",\n  \"content\": \" IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) treatment & marking according to ISPM 15 (latest version) Template: EA-QM-xx-P-001-F-01 Rev1.0 27/APR/2017 Print Date: 15/MAY/2023 Revision Date: Europe Business Management System 15/MAY/2023 EA-SC (Significant/Special Characteristic)-xx-M-001 Revision Level: Supplier  Logistics Manual MANUAL REV 1.1 CONFIDENTIAL: This information is Yazaki (Yazaki EMEA) property and must follow applicable global and regional confidentiality rules.

The part bearing boxes need to lie on its four corners. If this is not possible, a cardboard layer no larger than the pallet footprint has to be added. The folding boxes shall be aligned vertically. Brick or interlocking stacking is not allowed. Figure 2 Palletization Requirements 4.2.9 Stacking All pallet loads shall assure a safe stacking and enable optimal transport and storage volume utilization. Palletized loading units must, under dynamic circumstances (during transport), withstand a stacking height of three pallet loads of the same footprint and weight or a height of 3,00 m, assuring all products to arrive in undamaged condition at the final point of use. The minimum Box Compression Test (BCT (Box Compression Test)) value of the selected corrugated box shall be determined based on this dynamic transport condition, considering a safety factor of at least 3.

In the event of any transportation damages, unless otherwise agreed between YAZAKI  and Supplier  in the individual case, the party that has commissioned, and pays, the freight forwarder shall be responsible for the securing and handling of any claims for damages against the freight forwarder. In case the packaging is considered unsuitable or needs to be improved the Supplier  is alerted. Supplier , SM (Supply Management), quality, and packaging engineering work together for improving packaging. Verification shall be done by performing the necessary tests such as drop test (Ref: VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie (German Automotive Association)) Recommendation 4535, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 2206 / ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 2248), BCT (Box Compression Test), and shipment trial.

Therefore, this test shall be planned before PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) approval. 4.4 Labeling YAZAKI  is using a material handling system based on SAP. In support of this initiative, all components and raw material Suppliers that supply to YAZAKI  or any of its affiliate locations are required to attach barcoded labels according to the known European automotive standards (Odette or VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie (German Automotive Association))), on each pallet unit and handling unit.
